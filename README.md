# Try-Catch Statements

In this quest, we will build a basic web application that calculates the Fibonacci Sequence. We will integrate Try-Catch-Finally Statements to help us handle any erroneous data input by the user.

The Fibonacci Sequence, a distinctive mathematical series, is derived by adding the last two numbers in the sequence. Consequently, the numbers within this sequence are positive whole values. Given our understanding of these requirements, it is important to acknowledge that users may occasionally input invalid numbers or characters into our web application.

To address this situation, we will employ Try-Catch Statements, which enable us to detect and handle these invalid inputs appropriately. Without further delay, let us commence our journey to refine our data validation skills through the application of Try-Catch statements in JavaScript.
